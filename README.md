# ETL Pipeline Project
This project contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented in Python. The pipeline is designed to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading processes, making it easier to manage and process data from various sources.

**Project Structure**  
The project is organized into four main scripts:

extract.py - Handles the extraction of data from the source.
transform.py - Manages the transformation of the extracted data.
load.py - Loads the transformed data into the desired destination.
etl_pipeline.py - Combines the extraction, transformation, and loading processes into a single pipeline. 

**Getting Started**  
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.11
Necessary Python libraries (see requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Tar-ive/etl_project.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd etl_pipeline_project
Install the required libraries:
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the ETL pipeline, execute the etl_pipeline.py script:

sh
Copy code
python etl_pipeline.py
This will trigger the extraction, transformation, and loading of data as defined in the respective scripts.

Configuration
Ensure to configure the necessary parameters (like source paths, transformation rules, and destination paths) in the respective scripts (extract.py, transform.py, load.py) before running the pipeline.

Scripts Overview
extract.py
This script is responsible for extracting data from various sources. It includes functions to connect to data sources and retrieve data.

transform.py
This script transforms the extracted data into the desired format. It includes functions to clean, format, and process data to meet the requirements.

load.py
This script loads the transformed data into the destination. It includes functions to connect to databases or other data storage solutions and insert the processed data.

etl_pipeline.py
This script integrates the extraction, transformation, and loading processes into a cohesive pipeline. It coordinates the workflow and ensures data flows seamlessly from extraction to loading.

# ETL Pipeline

This repository contains scripts to perform the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data. Each phase of the ETL process is defined in separate scripts, and the pipeline is orchestrated by a main script.

## Configuration

Ensure to configure the necessary parameters (such as source paths, transformation rules, and destination paths) in the respective scripts (`extract.py`, `transform.py`, `load.py`) before running the pipeline.

## Scripts Overview

### extract.py
This script is responsible for extracting data from various sources. It includes functions to connect to data sources and retrieve data.

### transform.py
This script transforms the extracted data into the desired format. It includes functions to clean, format, and process data to meet the requirements.

### load.py
This script loads the transformed data into the destination. It includes functions to connect to databases or other data storage solutions and insert the processed data.

### etl_pipeline.py
This script integrates the extraction, transformation, and loading processes into a cohesive pipeline. It coordinates the workflow and ensures data flows seamlessly from extraction to loading.

## Usage

1. **Configure Parameters:** 
   - Update the source paths, transformation rules, and destination paths in `extract.py`, `transform.py`, and `load.py` respectively.

2. **Run the ETL Pipeline:**
   ```sh
   python etl_pipeline.py
   ```
